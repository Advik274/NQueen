# **App Name**: Queen's Gambit Visualizer

## Core Features:

- Dynamic Chessboard: Displays a dynamic chessboard grid based on user-selected N (number of queens) using alternating dark and light tiles for visual clarity.
- Animated Queen Placement: Visually represents the placement of queens on the chessboard, one step at a time, controlled by a timer for better understanding.
- Random Queen Placement: The 'Random Queen' tool selects a random value between 4 and 12 and navigates the user directly to the solution page, populated with a visualization for that value.
- Solution Display: Displays the solved chessboard, solution array, and queen positions in (row, column) coordinates.
- Animation speed control: Users can manually adjust the speed of queen placement with fine-grained control via on-screen buttons.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Deep blue (#003366) to maintain consistency with the existing design.
- Secondary color: Light grey (#f0f0f0) for chessboard tiles and background elements.
- Accent color: Gold (#FFD700) for highlights and queen icons.
- Use simple and elegant queen icons to represent the pieces on the chessboard.
- Maintain a clean and minimalist layout to ensure focus on the chessboard visualization.
- Subtle animations (fade-in, slide) for queen movements to enhance the user experience.
